This mod is to make all the Flatout 2 tracks be free roam. 

You'll be able to drive anywhere on the tracks. But be careful there are some holes in the tracks that you can fall into. Apparently the tracks are 100% finished. lol. 

To run this mod you will need to unpack your bfs files, and run the game "unpacked". If you do not know how to do this please read this Tutorial: http://flatoutjoint.com/content/view/82/1/

Now to apply this mod to your unpacked game download the FO2_Full_Track_Roam.exe to your Flatout2 root folder (default location is: c:\program files\Empire Interactive\FlatOut2\ )

Double click on the FO2_Full_Track_Roam.rar (You'll need Winrar) and extract to the path that is has listed. Click yes to over write files. 

That's it. Start your game up, and start exploring them tracks!

Enjoy,

Muratus
